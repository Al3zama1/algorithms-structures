import java.util.Arrays;

/*
Number of comparisons: (n - 1) + (n - 2) + (n - 3) + ..... + 1 = n(n - 1) / 2 nearly equals to n2.

Complexity = O(n2)

Also, we can analyze the complexity by simply observing the number of loops. There are 2 loops so the complexity is n*n = n2.

Time Complexities:

Worst Case Complexity: O(n2)
If we want to sort in ascending order and the array is in descending order then, the worst case occurs.
Best Case Complexity: O(n2)
It occurs when the array is already sorted
Average Case Complexity: O(n2)
It occurs when the elements of the array are in jumbled order (neither ascending nor descending).

Selection Sort Applications
The selection sort is used when

- a small list is to be sorted
- cost of swapping does not matter
- checking of all the elements is compulsory
- cost of writing to a memory matters like in flash memory (number of writes/swaps is O(n) as compared to O(n2) of bubble sort)
